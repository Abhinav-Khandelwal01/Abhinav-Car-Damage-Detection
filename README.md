# 🚗 Vehicle Damage Detection

This repository contains a **deep learning-based web application** for detecting vehicle damage from images. The app is built using **Streamlit** and a trained **PyTorch model** for damage classification.

---

## 📌 Features
- 📷 **Upload an image** of a damaged vehicle.
- 🧠 **Deep learning model** predicts the type of damage.
- 🎨 **Streamlit UI** for easy interaction.
- 🏎️ **Fast and accurate** damage classification.

---

## 🔥 Demo

---

## 📁 Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing various vehicle damage types, including:
- **Front Breakage**
- **Rear Damage**
- **Side Damage**
- **No Damage** (Healthy Vehicle)

---

## 🛠️ Installation

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhinav-Khandelwal01/Abhinav-Car-Damage-Detection.git
cd Abhinav-Car-Damage-Detection
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3️⃣ Run the App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🚀 Model Training
The model is trained using **PyTorch** and **CNN architectures**. If you want to retrain the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
Make sure you have the dataset inside the `data/` folder.

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Upload an image** of a damaged vehicle.
2. The model processes the image and predicts the damage class.
3. The result is displayed on the web interface.
